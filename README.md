  ## Installation
  In order to use this application, first download the repository folder. You must then install node.js, if not already installed on your machine. 

  ## Usage
  Once the application is installed, along with node.js, use a terminal to navigate to the directory containing the index.js file and run <node app>. This will initialize the user prompts. Complete each prompt, and then navigate to the 'dist' subdirectory. Your generated index.html file will be located here, along with a copy of the style.css file, which can then be used as you see fit.
